## Description
The `main.sh` script performs various operations on a CSV file, including extracting unique cities, identifying top earners, calculating average salaries per city, and identifying individuals with salaries above the overall average.

## Deployment

1. Ensure the script file `main.sh` is executable. If not, run the following command:

```bash
  chmod +x main.sh
```

2. Execute the script by providing two filenames as arguments in the following format:



```bash
  ./main.sh input_file output_file
```

Replace `input_file` with the name of the input CSV file and `output_file` with the desired name of the output file.
